PAYA - LEARNING BOOTSTRAP BY MODIFYING TEMPLATES

"Paya" is an online art/museum gallery containing the information about the musuems/galleries present in the local community and the type of arts that they showcase. It classifies the types of art present in the particular museum/art gallery into different categories such as sculptures, painting, architectures and more based on the type of the institution it is.

This idea for this website was discussed by a team of three members:
- Khushi Shrestha (Git Manager, Team lead) -- https://github.com/khushi12321
- Sichu Maharjan (UI/UX Designer) -- https://github.com/Sichu-Maharjan
- Aviyaan Shrestha (Content Manager) -- https://github.com/aviiii26

We researched for a suitable available template for our website idea online and found one on [Themefisher](https://themefisher.com/products/reader-bootstrap). After which, we changed the source code along with certain elements and added a few things to make the template our own. 
The website is still in DEVELOPMENT PHASE!

GIT
To download and use the very latest source off the Git server, do this:
```
git clone https://github.com/khushi12321/reader-bootstrap-main.git
```
(You'll get a directory named reader-bootstrap-main created filled with the source code)

WE ARE OPEN TO CONTRIBUTIONS, so please contact us on khushishrestha002@gmail.com for any positive and helpful changes to the website.
